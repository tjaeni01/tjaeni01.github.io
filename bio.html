        <h1>Bio of Tucker</h1>
        <p>I was born and raised in Wellesley, MA and lived there my whole life before coming to study at Tufts University in Medford, MA.I went through the Wellesley Pulic School system and thoroughly enjoyed it. Throughout high school I rowed at Comunity Rowing Inc., but now that I am at Tufts I have dropped crew in favor of ballroom dancing and ultimate frisbee.</p>
