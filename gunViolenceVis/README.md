This folder creates a visualization of gun violence in America. It builds a choropleth 
map of America that shows the different levels of gun violence in every county since 
2013. The visualization can be run by setting up a python simple HTTP server:

python3 -m http.server 8000

and then running http://localhost:8000/FinalVis.html in a web browser.
