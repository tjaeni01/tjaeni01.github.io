This projects implements an artificial neural network. Inlcuded in this
is a feed forward and backward propagation algorithm. The file takes in the 
dataset, seperates it into trainng and testing, then trains the ANN and finally
testing the trained ANN on the test set. The accuracy of the ANN varies from
100% to 50% on each iteration, but with the an accuracy above 90% being typical.

To run the program, simply type "python3 garden.py" in the command line. There are
various outputs of the program. The simplest is just outputting the accuracy 
(line 128). You can also uncomment lines to display stats for every iteration 
of training (lines 119-124) as well as the input and outputs of testing the NN
(line 127).
